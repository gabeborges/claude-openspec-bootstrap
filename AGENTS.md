- `/clavix:prd` - Generate a PRD through guided questions
- `/clavix:plan` - Generate implementation task breakdown from PRD
- `/clavix:implement` - Execute tasks or prompts with AI assistance
- `/clavix:start` - Start conversational mode for iterative refinement
- `/clavix:summarize` - Extract optimized prompt from conversation
- `/clavix:refine` - Refine existing PRD or prompt
- `/clavix:product` - Create product vision & strategy
